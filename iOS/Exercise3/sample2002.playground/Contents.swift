 1.Implement the parameterised initialisation with class or struct.

2.Write all the Rules of initialiser in Inheritance

Rule 1: A designated initializer must call a designated initializer from its immediate superclass.
Rule 2: A convenience initializer must call another initializer from the same class.
Rule 3: A convenience initializer must ultimately call a designated initializer

/* SUBSCRIPTSs
 
 What is subscript ? Write down the declaration syntax.
 Classes, structures, and enumerations can define subscripts, which are shortcuts for accessing the member elements of a collection, list, or sequence. You use subscripts to set and retrieve values by index without needing separate methods for setting and retrieval. For example, you access elements in an Array instance as some Array[index] and elements in a Dictionary instance as someDictionary[key].
 subscript(index: Int) -> Int {
 get {
 //code
 }
 set(newValue) {
 //code
 }
 }
